## Project Title
Library rentals
## Description
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I created it on 18.08.23 to practise using the useState() hook, specifically with an array.
## Features
HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
## How to use
This can be viewed at https://evg4.github.io/libraryrentals/. Functionality is basic and should be self-explanatory; click on the buttons under "Books available in library" and they will appear under "Books on your reading list". If you click the items in the reading list, they are removed from the list and the button become active again in the library section.
